I began this project as an exercise to integrate MGWT and GWTP, also I wanted to develop my own diary/agenda/planner all integrated in "one open everywhere app" using Google App Engine. So the base of the code employs the GWTP framework, objectify is used to manage GAE, the command pattern is employed to communicate with the server, and MGWT was integrated into the GWTP framework by creating a customized rootpresenter, based on the rootpresenter original code and the animatable display mechanisms coded on the MGWT showcase. Still the gui have some problems (is not working well on my android or chrome browser).However, the animation effects of the animatable display work pretty well and I made it very easy to make new presenters animate themselves just by firing a customized event on the revealinparent() method and giving the desired appearance animation as a parameter. I hope this project will help refine a good tools library to integrate both frameworks based mainly on the MVP GWTP paradigm. This is an eclipse project btw.
